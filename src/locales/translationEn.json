Freight trains can transport a variety of cargo, including freight containers, automobiles, cattle, grains, coal, minerals and metals. Bulk goods, standardized shipping containers, or particularly constructed carriages for a specific sort of freight can all be transported by freight trains. Rail freight travels far more quickly than ocean freight. It costs more than sea freight, but less than air freight. Moving high-value industrial products like automobiles, electronics, and computer equipment, as well as promotional items, by train is ideal."
